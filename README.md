### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Bloomberg. I believe in learning by doing, and I always welcome new, exciting challenges that will help me grow.

I graduated froom Princeton University with a Bachelors Degree on Mathematics with minors in (1) Computer Science and (2) Machine Learning. 

âš¡ Fun fact âš¡: When I type, I use all five fingers of my left hand, but just two fingers of my right hand.
