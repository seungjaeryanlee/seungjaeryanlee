### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I am a math major at Princeton University with minors in computer science and machine learning. I believe in learning by doing, and I always welcome new, exciting challenges that will help me grow. Each summer, I explored different interests, from conducting math research, founding a startup, and interning as a software engineer or a machine learning engineer. I also developed multiple personal projects and contributed to several open-source projects, I spend my free time teaching or translating, because I believe that sharing knowledge will make the world a better place.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me
